Zuul
====

Welcome to my text adventure: `Zuul`!

`Zuul` is a text adventure i made for school. In this text adventure you are lost at a university and you must escape befor you die of bloodloss.

The "world" is made up of diffrent `rooms` you can go to, all using the console. Each time you go to a new `room` you will lose one `healthpoint`. In the `rooms` are `items` wich you can use to get some good or bad luck, to heal yourself or to open locked `rooms`.

The `items` have a certain weight, so you can only take so much with you. When you use an `item` it will be lost and you will have less weight.

To play the game just go to the `release/Zuul.exe`. For help and the commands use `help`.

`Commands:`
	
	`help` show possible commands.
	`go [direction]` go in to the given direction (if possible).
	`quit` quit the game.
	`look` look in the room showing all items and directions.

	`take [item name]` pickup the item from the room.
	`drop [item name]` drop the item in the room.
